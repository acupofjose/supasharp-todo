## Integration with Supabase

Most of the code, where possible, has been placed into the [SupasharpTodo.Shared project](/SupasharpTodo.Shared/) and leverages Dependency Injection to handle cross-platform implementations.

The interfaces are specified in [SupasharpTodo.Shared.Interfaces](/SupasharpTodo.Shared/Interfaces/).

What will likely interest most developers using this repo as an example of Supabase's features are the files found in:

- [ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs](/SupasharpTodo.Shared/Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs) - handles registering Supabase in the App Builder.
- [SupabaseAuthenticationStateProvider.cs](/SupasharpTodo.Shared/Providers/SupabaseAuthenticationStateProvider.cs) - registers with Blazor's built-in authentication
- [SupabaseSessionProvider.cs](/SupasharpTodo.Shared/Providers/SupabaseSessionProvider.cs) - handles storing the session locally (platform dependent)

## For Developers

This project is built using Tailwind as the CSS framework, which requires compiling on a css change. The fastest way to develop is within the `SupasharpTodo.BlazorWASM` project.

You'll need to do an `npm install` in the root of the project to install Tailwind and its dependencies.

Two commands need to be running simultaneously for development:

```bash
# Either using `concurrently`
npm run dev:wasm

# Or in separate terminals...
# In root of repo
npm run dev:tailwind:wasm

# In `SupasharpTodo.BlazorWASM`
dotnet watch
```
